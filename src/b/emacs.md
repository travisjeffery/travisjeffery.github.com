Is Emacs worth using in 2025?

I've used Emacs my whole career, aside from first few years using Vim. I became very proficient with Vim, and if programming or writing was just about editing text then Vim's motions would be enough. But programming is much than editiing text, you need to navigate your projects, run tests, look up docs, run CLI commands and so on. And Emacs is the all around best environment because you can make it do anything.

Is Emacs still worth using? Absolutely I think. I don't

The two main things I would like in Emacs in the future:

- improved support for async execution for improved responsiveness and
  consistency, like what Neovim achieved building on libuv.
-

Why use Emacs today?

- You can use it for pretty much everything - programming, running terminal commands, writing books, managing your taxes ('m not kidding https://github.com/ledger/ledger-mode).
- Emacs has LSP and Tree-Sitter support built in.
- Emacs will be around forever. As the Lindy effect says: the future life expectacy of a non-perisable thing (like a technology or an idea) is proportional to its current age. Emacs isn't the most popular editor. But it's been around forever. It has a healthy following. There is nothing else like it. The core is solid. So it will continue on.
- Programming LISP is fun and powerful, and I think an ideal environment for building out and customizing something personal like an editor. When working with other people, I prefer boring languages like Go.

Why use Emacs over Vim?

My first few years or so I used Vim, became proficient with the motions, and began writing my own extensions in Vim script. Extending Vim is what motivated me to switch to Emacs.


1. Well architected and extensible. You can make Emacs work how ever
you want. This helps future proof it too. Emacs is well thought out
and well written. I've used ideas from Emacs in my own programs to
make them extensible.

2. Its toolkit is amazing. Org Mode, Magit, Dired, Calc, Projectile,
TRAMP, Eshell, Proced where there aren't comperables, if there are
comperables, then Emacs outclasses them.

3.

There's a reason why none of the other Emacs implementations never took
off in the way that NeoVim took off. Emacs is too good, the core
team will put almost anything good and generally useful into core,
anything can be left as third-party and is still able to be as
powerful, and the core of Emacs is good enough.

There's been other implementations in Rust, and building on Guile.

There are an infinite amount of things I could mention. Emacs really
does follow this image when it comes to its learning curve and your
skill with it. But to me that makes it even cooler, that I have a tool
I'll use my entire life and genueily keep learning the entire time.

Could I write in Vim faster, absolutely. But programminga and writing
or doing anything on the computer is more than just writing. You're
running tests, running shell commands, managed processes, working with
version control, calculating, managing files, and so on. And Emacs can
do it all and do it as well as anything.
