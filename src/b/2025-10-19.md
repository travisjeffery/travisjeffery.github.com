At Oscilar things have gone well. The engineering team's remained small. The infrastructure team consists of two people. Myself for four years and we hired one person in Europe last year for timezone coverage. I had not interviewed anyone since leaving Confluent, or Segment before that.

Interviewing at Segment had been straightforward. Segment's network was built on open-source and Our candidates often came from the open-source community. They knew our work. These were programmers who wrote code professionally and then wrote more code in their spare time. They contributed to projects or built their own. This meant they were better than average.

At Confluent I saw something different. Confluent's network was traditional Bay Area. Confluent was a notable startup rising like a rocket. We had our pick of candidates. I interviewed a lot of Staff and Principal engineers from FANG. 

By 2025 things had become stranger. At Oscilar we now had AI to consider. I do not mean engineers using AI as a tool. I mean people who cannot write code at all. I know they are not using AI because nothing gets written. These people call themselves senior engineers. They have worked for ten years.

They seem surprised when I ask them to write code. The job posting asks if they have strong programming skills. They have answered yes. Then the fear shows on their faces. They understand what is about to happen.

The problem I give is simple. I do not ask data structure questions. I ask them to read a file and extract information. A loop, a hashmap, basic operators. This is what programming is.

People say the job market is difficult. After seeing this I am not sure what they mean. Most candidates cannot think through problems or write programs. Without AI they can do nothing. But if AI does the work, why would a company hire them? The company could use the AI directly.
