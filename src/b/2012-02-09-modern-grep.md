Update: I updated the post for ripgrep.

grep reigned as the preeminent text search tool for a long time. Yet grep's overly unopinionated
approach to defaults and maintaining backwards compatibility allowed new tools --- namely; ack,
the silver searcher, and ripgrep --- to encroach on its territory.

grep is ubiquitous. unix-like systems come with grep installed and you can install grep on Windows. I search with ripgrep on my computer because I can install it once and use its features day-to-day. When I work on remote systems, it's more efficient to search with grep.

In a large project, a search by a newbie ack user takes less time than the same search by a newbie
grep user. ack conveniently ignores folders and files you probably don't want searched ---
like .git or the files listed in your .gitignore.

With some grep know-how, we can make grep faster and behave like these modern search tools.

## Exclude directories

grep can exclude directories that it searches, increasing its speed substantially. The following excludes the .git directory from the grep search:

    $ grep --exclude-dir=.git

This speeds up searches by a lot, I ran two uncached searches in Rails's repo:

    $ grep -r "class << self" .
    $ grep -rIPs --exclude-dir=.[a-zA-Z0-9]* --exclude=.* --exclude=*~ "class << self" .

He former, non-excluding, grep took 6.009s. The
latter, excluding, grep took 2.235s.

## Perl regular expressions

Modern search tools like ack support the popular Perl regular expressions. By default, grep uses
the less known POSIX regular expressions.

For example, let's say we want to match a phone number and capture its area
codes.

- The Perl regular expression:

        (\d{3})-\d{3}-\d{4}

- The POSIX regular expression:

        \([0-9]\{3\}\)-[0-9]\{3\}-[0-9]\{4\}

Fortunately, you can use Perl regular expressions with grep by giving it the
`-P` or `--perl-regexp` argument.

    grep -P "(\d{3})-\d{3}-\d{4}"

## Useful defaults

Having to give grep all these arguments would be a drag, to configure grep to exclude hidden directories and use Perl regular expressions by default, set the shell variable `GREP_OPTIONS`:

    export GREP_OPTIONS='-rIPs --exclude-dir=.[a-zA-Z0-9]* --exclude=.* --exclude=*~ --color=auto'

## Git grep

There's no argument to make grep organize its output like ack. Also, neither
integrates with git, but git has its own grep for searching your repos. You can read my post on [searching git like a ninja](/b/2012/02/search-a-git-repo-like-a-ninja/) to learn about `git grep` and get the best of both grep and ack.
