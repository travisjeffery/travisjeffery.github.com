I wanted to improve security at Oscilar by adding just-in-time permissions. The idea: everyone gets read-only access by default. When you need to do something, you request elevated access for a limited time.

I looked at two third-party services. Both charged $1000 per seat. We have 60 people. That's $60K a year. We'll probably double that by next year. For software we'd host ourselves. Software that stores almost nothing, uses almost no compute, and does almost no work - it authorizes a few requests per person per day. So I built our own with Claude. It took a day.

It's a Slack app backed by a small service called admitter. People request access with a slash command:

```
/access <group> <duration> <reason>
```

We have three permission sets: Viewer, Developer, Administrator. Developer access auto-approves. Administrator requires someone to approve it in Slack. Once approved, the service adds you to the right Google Group, which syncs to AWS Identity Center within a minute. You get access for the time you asked for, up to a configured max.

That's it. A day of work. No operating costs. Saving $60K+ a year.

A lot of B2B software exists in this category - not complex enough to justify the price, but annoying enough that nobody wanted to build it. The build-vs-buy math used to favor buying. It doesn't anymore.
