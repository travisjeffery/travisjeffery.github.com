Chrome released a new Web Inspector feature called Dock to right. This feature allows you to
vertically split your screen, with your web page on the left, and Web Inspector tools on the right. If you work on a widescreen, then you'll love this feature.

To enable the feature, open the Web Inspector, click on the gear icon at the bottom right of the Web
Inspector, and check off Dock to right. Chrome made this feature available in the stable channel on
Mar 28 in v18. So you probably have the feature already and if not, just update to get it.

Thanks Chrome devs!
