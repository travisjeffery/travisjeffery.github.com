It's been a while since I've written a blog post. I've written a book, built Confluent Cloud, been building Oscilar's infrastructure, restoring heritage houses, raising kids. 

My blog was built on Metalsmith and after all these years the Metalsmith packages were out of date and wouldn't build. I didn't even have Node installed at first. So I switched to Hugo. Claude Code handled the bulk of the migration.

Hugo's a single binary, fast, uses Go's templating language, and has all the features needed to build a blog. 

I'll be writing much more now.
