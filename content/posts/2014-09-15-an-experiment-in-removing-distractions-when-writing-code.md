about a week ago, i turned off syntax highlighting in my editor, emacs.

no line numbers.

i especially saw this when working on ruby projects. wherein when a file crossed the 100 loc point, then there'd be an attempt to "simplify". but it really meant that some lines would be moved, complexity stayed the same, but you had an extra step or two to know where everything was.

one belief is that syntax highlighting helps you narrow in on the code and focus on parts that matter, e.g. does a string end and so on. but in my experience it ends up being a fallacy. without syntax highlighting everything is equally important, strings, functions, etc. whereas with syntax highlighting certain parts of your code get more attention due to their color, e.g. if strings are brighly colors your eyes will be drawn to them and taken away from the big picture.
