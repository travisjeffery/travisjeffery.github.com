commits of people&amp;rsquo;s prs. I wanna give attribution for good contributions and
not have my name associated with nasty hacks, so when i interactively rebase
commits i want to make sure the new commit(s) has the right author.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By default when you interactively rebase, git will say you&amp;rsquo;re the author. So
you need to explicitly set this otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Quick staging and other file operations in git</title><link>https://travisjeffery.com/posts/2012-11-01-quick-staging-and-other-file-operations-in-git/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Nov 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://travisjeffery.com/posts/2012-11-01-quick-staging-and-other-file-operations-in-git/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Having a modular and well-organized code is clearly great from an architectural
standpoint, but it can make the actual filesystem layout and hierarchy of your
project a little complex, now that text editors and IDEs also have good
fuzzy finding capabilities you can largely not worry about this and still
code efficiently. But when working with Git as your version control it does
help to be intimate with the filesystem layout of your project, or at least
have some tricks up your sleeve. In this post I&amp;rsquo;d like to share some tricks I
use.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Using git's include for private configuration information (like github tokens)</title><link>https://travisjeffery.com/posts/2012-03-09-using-gits-include-for-private-information-like-github-tokens/</link><pubDate>Fri, 09 Mar 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://travisjeffery.com/posts/2012-03-09-using-gits-include-for-private-information-like-github-tokens/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Git added a &lt;a href="https://github.com/git/git/commit/9b25a0b52e09400719366f0a33d0d0da98bbf7b0"&gt;feature&lt;/a&gt;
that enables you to split your Git config across multiple files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I store my dotfiles in a public Git repo but I had to exclude my .gitconfig file because it contained by GitHub access token. With this feature, I have a .gitconfig file that contains the config I&amp;rsquo;d like public and a .githubconfig file that has the config I don&amp;rsquo;t want public. I add .githubconfig to the .gitignore file to make sure I don&amp;rsquo;t check it in by accident.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Search a git repo like a ninja</title><link>https://travisjeffery.com/posts/2012-02-02-search-a-git-repo-like-a-ninja/</link><pubDate>Thu, 02 Feb 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://travisjeffery.com/posts/2012-02-02-search-a-git-repo-like-a-ninja/</guid><description>&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ git grep &amp;lt;regexp&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Try it out on a project, then try the same search with ack and grep and you see
that we have speed that&amp;rsquo;s better than either grep or ack. But we can make some
improvements:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Allow extended regular expressions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt; $ git config --global grep.extendRegexp true
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;git can also support full blown Perl regular expressions as well, by compiling
git with libpcre. Easy for &lt;a href="https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew"&gt;homebrew&lt;/a&gt;

less frequent and easier to resolve. Also, this helps keeps your branch graph simple. When
people have to make complicated merges, it&amp;rsquo;s often because their branch graph is complex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep things simple!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People fear Git, fear making a mistake that ruins their repo, and fear the ensuing embarrassment. Some people fear rebasing so much that they only merge. I&amp;rsquo;m going to use a botched rebase as an example of how you can recover from anything with the reflog.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
